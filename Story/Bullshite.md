[[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo]] is a Senator for the Alderaan Sector and a member of the New Republic High Command by virtue of being a Hero of Yavin.
Using her position she has commissioned the salvage of the DS1 Orbital Battle Station for constructing a large space station to act as a refuge for Alderaanians and all those displaced by the Galactic Civil War ("Breha Base???") 

THE NEW REPUBLIC uses Leia as a propaganda figure


- starfighter go into hyperspace but never re-appear or appear completely empty or with some form of time displacement
- NAVY OF THE NEW SITH!!!



Following the death of Darths Sidious and Vader, the Sith are destroyed forever. This actually causes further, more subtle, unbalance in the Force compared to the Sith being too powerful. The Force wanting to achieve equilibrium, creates new avatars for the Dark-Side of the Force. 


Corrupting some students of Luke Skywalker's new Jedi Academy (Endor or Dagobar or something idk - deffo not Coruscant) into misinterpreting his teachings about Anakin and forming the CULT OF VADER 



[[Jar Jar Binks]] is a Sith Lord
